This package "org.jcp.jsr331.scheduler" describes a generic Java programming interface for defining and solving scheduling
and resource allocation problems. It is based on the 
<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/proposalDetails?id=331"> JSR-331 "Constraint Programming API" </a> but it 
is not a part of the standard.

<p> It supports the following major concepts:
<ul>
<li> <strong>Schedule</strong> as a factory and a placeholder for different activities, resources and constraints between them.
<li> <strong>Activity</strong> that is a task or work to be performed in a schedule. Activities have a duration and can be 
executed without breaks over a specific time intervals in a schedule. They may be subject to temporal and precedence constraints.
They may require or produce different resources.
<li> <strong>Resource</strong> that is used to represent a resource of finite not negative capacity that can vary with time. 
Each activity may require some amount of the capacity of a resource. 
There are discrete resources and boolean resources (with maximal capacity 1).
This version of the API specifies only recoverable and consumable resources.
</ul>
</p>

<p>To find the problem solutions, the API uses predefined search strategies. 
</p>

<p>The API covers basic scheduling and resource allocation constraints implemented on the top of JSR-331 in a CP solver independent way.
