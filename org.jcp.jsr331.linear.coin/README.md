[JSR331 “Java Constraint Programming API”](http://jsr331.org) is a JCP Specification Standard that has been developed under the terms of the www.JCP.org. 

# Project org.jcp.jsr331.coin
This project provides the JSR331 implementation of a linear solver that is based on  an open-source linear programming solver ["COIN"](https://projects.coin-or.org/Clp) written in C++. It is avaible from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenRulesSupport/jsr331/tree/master/org.jcp.jsr331.linear.coin). 

# Installation
As this implementation uses the COIN's executable **clp.exe**, you need to download this executable from https://www.coin-or.org/downloading/ and make sure that your Environment variable PATH includes the path to clp.exe.
