/**
 * An implementation of a {@link Goal} that finds all solutions using the same search goal.
 * This goal executes the "goal"-parameter to find a solution. If a solution is found,
 * the GoalAllSolutions fails (to mark the found solution as "already tried"), and
 * executes the "goal"-parameter again until the are no pther solutions. It is the
 * responsibility of the "goal"-parameter to save each found solution (if necessary).
 * Example of use:
 * <pre>
 *
 *  Constrainer C = new Constrainer("Constrainer Test");
 *  IntVar x = C.addIntVar(0,10,"x");
 *  IntVar y = C.addIntVar(0,10,"y");
 *  IntVar z = C.addIntVar(0,1000,"z");
 *  x.more(3).post();
 *  x.less(y).post();
 *  z.equals(C.sum(x,y)).post();
 *  IntExpArray vars = new IntExpArray(C, x,y,z);
 *  Goal solution = new GoalAnd(new GoalGenerate(vars),
 *                              new GoalPrintSolutionNumber(C),
 *                              new GoalPrint(vars));
 *  Goal all_solutions = new GoalAllSolutions(solution);
 *  C.execute(all_solutions);
 * </pre>
