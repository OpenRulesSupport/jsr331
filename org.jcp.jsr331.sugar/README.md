[JSR331 “Java Constraint Programming API”](http://jsr331.org) is a JCP Specification Standard that has been developed under the terms of the www.JCP.org. 

# Project org.jcp.jsr331.sugar
This project provides the JSR331 implementation of a constraint solver that is based on the open source Java constraint programming library "sugar" v. 2.1.3 developed by Naoyuki Tamura (tamura@kobe-u.ac.jp) from [Kobe University](https://www.kobe-u.ac.jp/en/index.html). It is available from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenRulesSupport/jsr331/tree/master/org.jcp.jsr331.sugar). 

# Installation
As we do not have the source code of Sugar 2.1.3, you need to add two Sugar's jar files to your Maven's system folder ~/.m2. You can do it by running the bat-file **installSugar.bat** from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenRulesSupport/jsr331/tree/master/org.jcp.jsr331.sugar/lib).
