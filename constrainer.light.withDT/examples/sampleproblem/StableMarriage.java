/**
 * Title: StableMarriage<br>
 * Description: (was taken from ILOG Solver User Manual)<br>
 * This widely studied problem is usually formulated like this: a
 * group of men and women must marry.  Each of those people knows
 * how to quantify his or her preferences in a mate.  They also
 * know how to rank the candidates for spouse in a list ordered by
 * preference.  The first name on such a list represents the
 * candidate that the owner of the list most prefers as a spouse.
 * The last such name indicates his or her least desirable spouse
 * among the possible candidates.<br>
 * The point of the problem is to create couples with the least
 * risk of separation after marriage.  What contributes to risk
 * of separation? Or, to put the question another way, what makes
 * stable marriages?<br>
 * One factor is whether each person is matched with his or her
 * first choice.  Clearly, if both partners in a couple prefer
 * each other to any other candidate, then their marriage should
 * be stable.<br>
 * A second factor is whether a person matched with anyone other
 * than his or her first choice prefers some third person who also
 * prefers him or her.  Perhaps a few names will clarify this point.
 * Let's say that Romeo is matched with Isolde, and Tristan with
 * Juliette, but as we all know, Romeo prefers Juliette to Isolde,
 * and Juliette prefers Romeo to Tristan.  These two couples are
 * consequently unstable and risk separating.<br>
 * In more or less formal terms, we say that a couple, A and B, is
 * stable if one of these conditions holds:
 * <UL>
 *   <LI>
 *     A is the first choice of B, and B is also the first choice of A.
 *   </LI>
 *   <LI>
 *     If B is not the first choice of A, then for every person C that
 *     A prefers to B, C still prefers someone else more than A. (In
 *     colloquial terms, A may be unhappy but stuck with the match!)
 *   </LI>
 * </UL>
 * Those conditions will be represented in the problem as constraints
 * on the assignment of spouses.<br>
