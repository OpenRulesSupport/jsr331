The definition of a RuleExecutionSet is not within the scope of the JSR 94. 
The implementation given in this file is written for the reference 
implementation. A rule engine vendor verifying their rule engine should 
modify this file to their specific needs.

This RuleExecutionSet will be invoked by the TCK in a stateless manner.

The rule execution set must have support for the following business object 
model:
-	Customer Class.
The Customer business object is a simple business object that contains a 
name and credit limit property. The definition of this class can be found in 
org.jcp.jsr94.tck.model.Customer
-	Invoice Class.
The Invoice business object is a simple business object that contains a 
description, amount, and status property. The definition of this class 
can be found in org.jcp.jsr94.tck.model.Invoice

The rule execution set has the following definition:
-	Support Customer and Invoice business objects.
-	Defines 1 logical rule.
Rule1:
If the credit limit of the customer is greater than the amount of the 
invoice and the status of the invoice is unpaid then 
decrement the credit limit with the amount of the invoice and 
set the status of the invoice to "paid".

Note:
Additional physical rules may be defined to accomplish the 
requirements mentioned above.

The rule execution set has the following semantics:
Input: 
-	A Customer with a credit limit of 5000.
-	An Invoice with an amount of 2000.

The rule execution should produce the following output:
-	The credit limit of the customer is 3000
-	The status of the invoice is paid.
