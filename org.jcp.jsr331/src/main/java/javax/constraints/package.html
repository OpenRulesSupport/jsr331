<title> JSR-331 "Java Constraint Programming API" v.1.0.1 </title>


</head>
<body bgcolor="white">

This package describes a generic Java programming interface for Constraint Programming (CP API)
- see <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/proposalDetails?id=331"> www.jcp.org </a>.

<p> CP API supports two clearly separated concepts:
<ul>
<li> Problem Definition (class Problem): contains all Constrained Variables and
Constraints that define and control relationships between constrained objects
<li> Problem Resolution (class Solver): contains search algorithms for finding problem solutions.
</ul>
</p>
<p>The Constrained Variables are represented in form of Java objects
which may use the predefined constrained variables types such as Var, VarBool, VarReal, and
VarSet.
</p>
<p>The Constraints themselves are objects inherited from a generic class Constraint.
The API covers major binary and global constraints required for the practical CP
programming. 
</p>
<p>To find the problem solutions, the API uses predefined search algorithms expressed
by class SearchStrategy. There are predefined methods that allow a user to find a feasible  solution, 
all solutions, or an optimal solution.
