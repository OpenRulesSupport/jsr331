/**
 * An implementation of a {@link Goal} that finds a solution which minimizes
 * a constrained integer variable called the "cost".
 * <p>
 * This goal uses the search goal provided by the caller, and expects
 * that this goal instantiates the cost every time when a solution is found.
 *
 * To search for a solution which provides the minimal cost,
 * GoalFloatFastMinimize finds a solution, posts the constraint that the
 * cost variable should be less then the found cost and continues the search.
 * <p>
 * In contrast with GoalFloatMinimize, when a solution is found GoalFloatFastMinimize
 * does not restore all decision variables, but continues the search just with
 * a more strict constraint to the cost variable.
 *
 * When there are no solutions anymore, the latest found solution is the optimal one.
 * <p>
 * By default, GoalFloatFastMinimize calculates the optimal solution twice.
 *
 * If the caller's search goal saves every found solution itself, the caller may
 * specify the mode "goal_saves_solution" to prevent the duplicate calculation
 * at the end of the search.
 *
 * @see GoalFloatMinimize
