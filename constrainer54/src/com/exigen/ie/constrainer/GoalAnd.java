/**
 * A goal can be defined in terms of it's subgoals. <code>Class GoalAnd</code> makes it
 * possible to create a goal composed of a sequence (up to six) of other goals.
 * To overcome the restriction of six goals imposed by it's constructors
 * one can use the following trick: let's assume the goalsArray to be an array of goals
 * <pre>
 * Goal tempGoal = new GoalAnd(goalsArray.get(0),goalsArray.get(1));
 * for (int i = 2; i &lt goalsArray.size(); i++){
 *    tempGoal = new GoalAnd(tempGoal, goalsArray.get(i));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * GoalAnd pushes all it's subgoals to the execution stack.
 * It succeeds if and only if
 * all it's subgoals succeed. In that case it returns null otherwise it generates an
 * exception of type Failure.
 *
