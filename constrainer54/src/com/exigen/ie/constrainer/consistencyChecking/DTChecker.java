/**
 * <p>Title: </p>
 * <p>Description: DTChecker is the interface to execute completeness and overlappings monitoring
 * for the given Decision Table</p>
 * <p>Decision Table has to relate every state of an object with an appropriate action. So there could
 * arise two kind  of problems: the first is incompletness, in other words there could exist points in the
 * state of spaces not covered by any rule and the second is overlapping. Overlapping is the situation in
 * which the same state of an object could be handled by two or more rules, possibly implying
 * opposite actions to be performed. Such situations are rarely being the consequences of the well planned
 * rule policy so the user would rather be notified. </p>
