/**
 * Title: FamilyRiddle <br>
 * Description: (was taken from ILOG Solver User Guide)<br>
 * Let's assume that Rene and Leo are both heads of household,
 * and--what a coincidence---both families include three girls
 * and three boys.  The youngest child in Leo's family is a girl,
 * and in Rene's family, a little girl has just arrived.  In
 * other words, there is a girl in Rene's family whose age is
 * less than one year.  Neither family includes any twins, nor
 * any children closer in age than a year.<br>
 * <br>
 * All the children are under age ten.  In each family, the sum
 * of the ages of the girls is equal to the sum of the ages of
 * the boys; in fact, the sum of the squares of the ages of the
 * girls is equal to the sum of the squares of the ages of the
 * boys.  The sum of the ages of all these children is 60.<br>
 * <br>
 * Here's our riddle: what are the ages of the children in these
 * two families?<br>
