[JSR331 “Java Constraint Programming API”](http://jsr331.org) is a JCP Specification Standard that has been developed under the terms of the www.JCP.org. 

# Project org.jcp.jsr331.gurobi
This project provides the JSR331 implementation of a linear solver that is based on the commercial linear programming solver ["GUROBI"](https://www.gurobi.com/products/gurobi-optimizer/). Its JSR331 interface is avaible from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenRulesSupport/jsr331/tree/master/org.jcp.jsr331.linear.gurobi). 

# Installation
To use this JSR331 with GUROBI, you need to get a GUROBI's license and its executable **gurobi_cl.exe** - contact https://www.gurobi.com/. You will need to make sure that your Environment variable PATH includes the path to gurobi_cl.exe.
