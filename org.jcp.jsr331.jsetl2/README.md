[JSR331 “Java Constraint Programming API”](http://jsr331.org) is a JCP Specification Standard that has been developed under the terms of the www.JCP.org. 

# Project org.jcp.jsr331.jsetl
This project provides the JSR331 implementation of a constraint solver that is based on the open source Java constraint programming library "JSetL" v. 2.3. It is available from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenRulesSupport/jsr331/tree/master/org.jcp.jsr331.jsetl). 

# Installation
As we do not have the source code of JSetL-2 anymore, you need to add JSetL's jar file to your Maven's system folder ~/.m2. You can do it by running the bat-file **installJSetL.bat** from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenRulesSupport/jsr331/tree/master/org.jcp.jsr331.jsetl/lib). 

*Note.* We work with the University of Parma to switch to the latest release of JSetL that will make this installation step unnecessary.
