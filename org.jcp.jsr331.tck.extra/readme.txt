This project contains additional examples that use means not included in the 
current release of the JSR-331. They utilize features provided in the 
interface javax.constraints.extra and partially implemented in the common
implementation - see packages javax.constraints.impl, 
javax.constraints.impl.search.goal.

Currently only constrainer supports these features.
